This is INSTALL file for RSS2POD product.
==================
REQUIREMENTS.
==================
This product initially was build to run on Linux platform. 
Before installation you need to be sure that your system has
some software, which is necessary to run rss2pod.
------------------------
Non Perl requirements.
------------------------
Redis - NoSQL database server.
gd - library to deal with graphix
lame - library and stand alone application for mp3 encoding
festival - text to speech engine
festival voices - voices for festival to work (rss2pod now support only English and Russian)
mp3wrap - command line utility to bundle mp3 files 
-----------------------
Perl requirements
-----------------------
In ideal world this requirements would be downloaded automatically.
The process of installation would be described below.
For installation itself, we need App::Build packet if we would install rss2pod 
with root credentials. We will provide this module within core installation archive,
but if you can install it yourself it would lead to less work during the installation process.
For installation without root credentials again you wold need nothing, but it
if you wold install Carton module it would save your time.

===========================
INSTALLATION PROCESS
===========================
Now let as assume that we already downloaded rss2pod project files,
and reside in the root directory of this project.
cd ./rss2pod

---------------------------------
INSTALLING WITH ROOT PRIVILEGES
---------------------------------
This part of the installation process requires root privileges, if you do not 
have ones go to the next section, where standalone installation would be described.
If you do not have App::Builder installed  on the your machine, than edit 
Build.PL and add this line 
use lib qw(/path/to/rss2pod/folder/local/lib/perl5); #$path_to_this_folder + /local/lib/perl5
!!HINT path to current folder we can gain via pwd command.
This line will add path to your local libs, where App::Build resides. 
After that run
perl ./Build.PL --install_base=/path/where/to/install
This will create Build script. Run it
./Build
./Build install

---------------------------------------
INSTALLATION WITHOUT ROOT PRIVILEGES

We will use carton as packets manager
