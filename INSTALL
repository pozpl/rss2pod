This is INSTALL file for RSS2POD.
==================
REQUIREMENTS.
==================
This product initially was build to run on the Linux platform. 
Before installation you need to be sure that your system has
some software, which is necessary to run rss2pod.
------------------------
Perl requirements
------------------------
This software was tested on the Perl 5.14 and above with a threads support.
NOTE!!! A threads support is essential because of some nasty bug or feature
in the NET::Daemon module, if it run in a fork mode, and we need to run the 'system' command.
It simply do not run it at all, with an error about childes... So since I do not have 
enough time to deal with it, be patient.

------------------------
Non Perl requirements.
------------------------
Linux – the only operation system on which I try this product.
Redis - NoSQL database server.
gd - library to deal with graphics.
lame - library and standalone application for mp3 encoding.
festival - text to speech engine.
festival voices - voices for festival to work (rss2pod now support only English and Russian)
cut - terminal command :)
-----------------------
CPAN requirements
-----------------------
In ideal world these requirements would be downloaded automatically.
The process of installation would be described below.
For installation itself, we need App::Build packet if we would install rss2pod with root credentials. 
We will provide this module within core installation archive, but if you can install it yourself it would lead to less work during the installation process. For installation without root credentials again you wold need nothing, but it if you wold install Carton module it would save your time.

===========================
INSTALLATION PROCESS
===========================
Now let as assume that we already downloaded rss2pod project files,
and reside in the root directory of this project.
cd ./rss2pod

---------------------------------
INSTALLING SYSTEM WIDE
---------------------------------
(This part now is deprecated, so go to the next section)
This part of the installation process requires root privileges, if you do not have it go to the next section, where standalone installation would be described.
If you do not have App::Builder installed  on the your machine, than edit 
Build.PL and add this line 
use lib qw(/path/to/rss2pod/folder/local/lib/perl5); #$path_to_this_folder + /local/lib/perl5
!!HINT path to current folder we can gain via pwd command.
This line will add path to your local libs, where App::Build resides. 
After that run
perl ./Build.PL --install_base=/path/where/to/install
This will create Build script. Run it
./Build
./Build install

---------------------------------------
STANDALONE INSTALLATION
---------------------------------------
Standalone installation will be performed by means of the Carton tool.
This meant that all necessary modules would be stored in project folder within local directory.

For the beginning let as choose a directory for rss2pod. Something like /var/ww/rss2pod will suffice. Put all files into this directory. Go there and run install_dep_carton.pl script. This script will automatically install all CPAN in ./local folder by means of Carton.

cd /var/www/rss2pod/
perl ./install_dep_carton.pl
---------------------------
OS Specific steps
-----------------------------
The next step is to put start scripts for rss2pod daemons into /etc/init.d/ directory

cp ./misc/rss2pod_start_script /etc/init.d/rss2pod

Then put start script conf file into /etc/conf.d directory

cp ./misc/rss2pod_conf /etc/conf.d/rss2pod

Edit /etc/conf.d/rss2pod file

RSS2POD_HOME="/var/www/rss2pod"
RSS2POD_LOCAL_LIB="/var/www/rss2pod/local/lib/perl5"
RSS2POD_LOCAL_ARCH_SPECIFIC_LIB="/var/www/rss2pod/local/lib/perl5/x86_64-linux-thread-debug-multi"

The last part  of path (x86_64-linux-thread-debug-multi) is depends on you perl installation and can be gained via perl -v command.

Install festival server run script. Since version of 1.9 in Gentoo and some other distros festival is shipped without server mode. To fix this copy start script for festival into /etc/init.d/ directory and server.scm into /etc/festival directory. 
This files can be found in ./misc/festival  directory.
