This is INSTALL file for RSS2POD product.
==================
REQUIREMENTS.
==================
This product initially was build to run on the Linux platform. 
Before installation you need to be sure that your system has
some software, which is necessary to run rss2pod.
------------------------
Perl requirements
------------------------
This software was tested on the Perl 5.14 and above with a threads support.
NOTE!!! A threads support is essential because of some nasty bug or feature
in the NET::Daemon module, if it run in a fork mode, and we need to run the 'system' command.
It simply do not run it at all, with an error about childes... So since I do not have 
enough time to deal with it, be patient.

------------------------
Non Perl requirements.
------------------------
Redis - NoSQL database server.
gd - library to deal with graphic
lame - library and stand alone application for mp3 encoding
festival - text to speech engine
festival voices - voices for festival to work (rss2pod now support only English and Russian)
cut - terminal command :)
-----------------------
CPAN requirements
-----------------------
In ideal world this requirements would be downloaded automatically.
The process of installation would be described below.
For installation itself, we need App::Build packet if we would install rss2pod 
with root credentials. We will provide this module within core installation archive,
but if you can install it yourself it would lead to less work during the installation process.
For installation without root credentials again you wold need nothing, but it
if you wold install Carton module it would save your time.

===========================
INSTALLATION PROCESS
===========================
Now let as assume that we already downloaded rss2pod project files,
and reside in the root directory of this project.
cd ./rss2pod

---------------------------------
INSTALLING SYSTEM WIDE
---------------------------------
(This part now is deprecated, so go to the next section)
This part of the installation process requires root privileges, if you do not 
have ones go to the next section, where standalone installation would be described.
If you do not have App::Builder installed  on the your machine, than edit 
Build.PL and add this line 
use lib qw(/path/to/rss2pod/folder/local/lib/perl5); #$path_to_this_folder + /local/lib/perl5
!!HINT path to current folder we can gain via pwd command.
This line will add path to your local libs, where App::Build resides. 
After that run
perl ./Build.PL --install_base=/path/where/to/install
This will create Build script. Run it
./Build
./Build install

---------------------------------------
STANDALONE INSTALLATION
---------------------------------------
Standalone installation will be performed by means of the Carton tool.
This meant that all necessary modules would be stored in project folder within 
local directory.

NOTE!!! In current state installation process is very raw, and need some axiomatization.
So this section will be accomplished when I will implement script for automatic install.
