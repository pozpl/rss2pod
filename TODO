RSS2POD TODO
There are a lot of work in this project, but here is main features that will be
implemented. Now all this stuff in disarray, but maybe in future I will accomplish
tasks to be done.


1. Improve language package for English to Russian and Russian to English transcriptions.
2. Write a lot of integration, unit and all kinds of tests for rss2pod AJAX interface.
3. Do something with internalization.
4. Improve Install mechanism for "stand alone" environment. Now this is a bunch of hand work, and this is sad :(
5. Make configuration more easy. Some system parameters should be got on the fly instead of by the hands.
6. Write better database access level.
7. Find solid Perl CMS for project instead of this ugly handmaid page that it has now.
8. Write config option for google analytics
